# YASS
Yet Another Soldering Station project based off of the STM32L451 MCU

See https://matthewgilpin.com/article/jbc-soldering-iron

# About
This soldering station uses an ILI9163 based display along with mosfets and opamps to control a JBC soldering iron. This project uses an STM32L451 MCU for all the UI and control systems

This code also implements a PID control loop system to limit oscillation and over shoot.

The code was developed and built with STM32CubeIDE
